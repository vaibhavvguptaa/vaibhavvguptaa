## 🧠 Who I Am

I’m a **Data Engineer with hands-on experience working on production systems**, focused on building **reliable, observable, and scalable data pipelines** that support analytics and AI use cases.

I started my career as a **MERN Stack Developer** and later transitioned into roles involving **ETL pipeline debugging, operational reliability, and large-scale knowledge systems**. This background gives me a strong engineering mindset around **failure handling, performance, and system design**.

Today, I work at the intersection of **Data Engineering and AI Platform Engineering**, ensuring that data systems are **AI-ready, resilient, and maintainable**.

> Strong AI systems are built on disciplined data engineering.
