# 👋 Hi, I’m Vaibhav Gupta (aka V)

🚀 **Data Engineer | AI / GenAI Platform Engineer (in progress)**  
💡 Focused on building **scalable data pipelines, cloud data platforms, and AI-ready systems**

---

## 🧠 About Me

I started my career as a **MERN Stack Developer**, then transitioned into a role where I worked on **production systems, ETL pipeline debugging, and operational reliability** while supporting large-scale knowledge systems.

That journey pushed me toward **Data Engineering and AI Platform Engineering**, where I now focus on:

- Building **reliable ETL pipelines**
- Designing **analytics-ready data models**
- Creating **GenAI-powered data systems**
- Writing **production-quality, observable code**

I believe **AI is only as good as the data pipelines behind it**.
